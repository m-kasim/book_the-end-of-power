Moses Naim

Elements of Power:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Shifting people's view on things: ----
* by CODE: Applying power by abiding by "invisible" and "universal" rules of conduct. (Golden Rule)
* by PITCH: The power to change someone's perception of something and making them want it
--- Making people directly do things which they would otherwise won't do: ---
* by REWARD: The power to make someone do something via giving them material rewards and seduction
* by MUSCLE: Applying power by force and coercion

- [More]: There are more people, more money, more food, more transport, more opportunities
- [Mobility]: Moving around is faster, easier, cheaper
- [Mentality]: Change of attitudes and expectations
- [Bureaucracy]: It's good when the process is centralized and there are economies of scale. It is not good when things are fragmented
- Micropowers: Small groups of people, thanks to the increased connectivity with the Internet are able to sap big corporations and governments via guerilla tactics
- A lost election can be won back, but new rules and regulations change the game for a long term periods.
- Movement has become easier
- Emerging Arab markets: In the Arab countries, there is a booming market for veiled fashion
- Young people are always problematic, because they have a tendency to challenge power
- Prepaid cards are used often by low-income families
- People from rich countries transfer a lot of money (to their relatives) via bank transfers to pour countries.
  In fact, this is more than the global investments
- 2012: White babies are a minority in US
- Expectations: People have a tendency to not be content with what they already have. They see what others have and they want it too!
- In times of economic crisis, social protests are very likely to happen!
- Since the world is more complicated, creating a bureaucracy is harder than ever
  Instead, it is possible to "control" people, by seducing them
- World Values Survey: Measure of global social values
- Global attitudes: People are more concerned for individualism, gender equality and opposing the authorities!
- Trust does not recover or recovers very slowly and only partially
- In USA only 25-35% of the people trust the government (down from 75%)
- Immigration: People move because they refuse to obey the local power and they believe they can find a better alternative
- Indians and emulation: Indians who have started to work in outsourcing in call centers wanted to emulate the Western style of life
- Women and education: Women with higher education tend to have a higher rate of divorce and they put off having children
- Creative destruction: The current "shift of power" is a part of Schumpeter's "Creative Destruction"
- Religions: Religions provides ways (and communities) to cope with difficult times, however when things improve people discover
  new options and they experiment with them. They start to abide by their belief system less and less. More money leads to less religious allegiance
- [Coercion] ("Muscle") is the hardest way to maintain power
- [Code]: Power through code is still a good way to maintain power
- Thanks to the [microplayers], the big [megaplayers] are losing power now
